# Gutil

This repository contains infrastructure and libraries that assist in extending 
C++ functionality that is currently not included in the open-source versions of
GoogleTest, Abseil, and Protocol Buffers (e.g. proto matching, proto ordering,
status matchers, test artifact writers, etc).

This is a work in progress.

This is not an officially supported Google product.
