# Gutil

This repository contains general-purpose utility functions that are currently 
missing in (the open-source versions of) GoogleTest, Abseil, and Protocol Buffers
(e.g. proto matching, proto ordering, status matchers, test artifact writers, etc).

This repository is meant to eventually go away, when better alternatives are
available directly in the mentioned libraries.

This is a work in progress.

This is not an officially supported Google product.
